              After passing the Final Selection, Zenitsu is seen talking to
              himself, fearing he will die one day. Every participant who

              sparrow.

              Zenitsu is bit by a spider, and only has 30 minutes before he also
              turns into a spider. Zenitsu faints from fear, and begins to fight
              while unconscious. Zenitsu defeats the demon with the first form:
              Thunderclap and Flash, Sixfold.

            Up until a certain point in the Training, Zenitsu was his usual
            cheerful, self. He was seen training diligently under the guidance
            of the Hashira, aiming to become stronger and protect his friends.
            However, a sudden shift in his demeanor caught everyone off guard.
            Zenitsu receives a mysterious letter that drastically alters his
            behavior. His once carefree spirit is replaced by a somber and
            determined outlook.

              In the Infinity Castle, Zenitsu undergoes a dramatic
              transformation, leaving behind his timid and hesitant nature. His
              usual cowardice is replaced by an unshakable resolve, and his
              once-hidden potential takes center stage. With newfound focus and
              precision, he stands stronger than ever, surprising both allies
              and enemies. Zenitsu's growth is not just in skill but in spirit,
              as he faces overwhelming challenges head-on, driven by an unspoken
              determination.
